Memoir is a genre of non-fiction written in the first person about a slice of life. There are subgenres of memoir and literary narrative non-fiction with which a writer should know and see where their own writing fits. These subgenres are rather fluid and change across time with readersâ€™ interests and current trends.- [Eat, Pray, Love](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19501.Eat_Pray_Love?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=1vvgJnJ3gW&rank=1) by Elizabeth Gilbert- [The Year of Magical Thinking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7815.The_Year_of_Magical_Thinking?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=Cm30nwPh5r&rank=1) by Joan Didion- [Looking Back: A Chronicle of Growing Up Old in the Sixties](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/430154.Looking_Back?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=67w6d9A1SW&rank=1) by Joyce Maynard
